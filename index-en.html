                                                The need for Somatics for Musicians© stems from musicians’ needs to improve their physical performance, to prevent problems related with intense and daily practice and to deal with a multitude of physical ailments. The knowledge acquired during a typical lesson prevents musculo-skeletal problems and enhances musicians’ knowledge on movement and choreography at a high level.</p>

Somatics for Musicians © systematically combines principles of established preventative, rehabilitative and re-educational techniques in an organized programme encompassing theory and practical application. Through regular and dedicated involvement, musicians experience and develop virtuosity, understanding of the anatomy of movement and the neuromuscular comprehension needed to apply in practice and performance.</p>

<p>A musician’s routine be it a student, performer or teacher, demands of the physical body feats similar to those of a champion athlete. Overuse of the same muscles for prolonged practice sessions as well as fixture of the same posture during practice, performance and improvisation can cause musculo-skeletal problems. In their mildest form these problems prevent musicians from reaching high levels of virtuosity and, as a result, of freedom in music. In their acutest form, however, these problems can terminate many a successful career.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the use of the self in a contemporary urban environment does not typically enjoy a balance between effort and rest and as a result both movement and rest lack quality, and as a result, virtuosity lacks quality too.</p>

<p>The most troublesome insufficiency in a musician’s body is lack of balance between effort and rest during general and specialized movement. In Somatics for Musicians© lessons emphasis is put on balancing and distributing effort and rest in the whole body and not only in localized areas. Although traditionally and vehemently followed, the practice of localized and focused effort in isolated areas of the body for the development of instrumental and vocal technique results in fatigue, lack of virtuosity and even injury.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these problems are not limited to the musculo-skeletal system. The constant or wrong contact with music practice can cause ENT, gastro-intestinal, breathing and even psychological problems.</p>

<p>“Gift” and “talent” are often linked with the mere mention of a music student; this link puts a lot of pressure on musicians who have had to suffer silently out of fear of professional exposure. Only recently have musicians been able to receive specialized and immediate medical help. Even nowadays, there are countries with an old tradition in western music that don’t provide specialized services to musicians such as counseling or medical care.</p>

<p>Although musicians’ problems have been recorded to exist towards the end of the 19th century, serious funding for specialized treatment of musculoskeletal problems of musicians came only after the peak of emergence of arm and hand problems due to overuse of personal computers in the United States.</p>

<p>The recent establishment of Performing Arts Medicine has opened up new paths for education, prevention and treatment of health problems concerning performing artists.</p>

<p>Performing Arts Medicine Association has contributed substantially to the creation of new ways of understanding instrumental and vocal techniques.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the most prestigious music schools and conservatoires internationally provide appropriate knowledge to music students and teachers for the improvement of technical performance and for a better understanding of the physical capabilities of their bodies.</p>

<p>In Greece, Somatics for Musicians© was initiated by Christos Noulis in 2003. Since, a plethora of students, teachers and performers have benefited from the wealth of theoretical and practical knowledge gained through Somatics for Musicians© by satisfying their virtuosic demands and ridding themselves of somatic problems.</p>

Why can’t I play a piece after having practiced it nonstop?<br>

Why can’t I always sing effortlessly? I always follow exactly what my teachers say.<br>

I’ve been playing with the same correct technique for years and never had a problem. Why has a problem occurred suddenly? I’ve changed nothing in my practice routine!<br>

It hurts when I practice. What can I do when I’ve got to keep practicing?<br>

I want to play faster but my hands seem to freeze in high speeds. Why?<br>

<p>Injuries in the hands, neck and back as a result of misuse and overuse is a problem that thousands of surgeons and physiotherapists cause to themselves

The Alexander Technique can help all of us if our problems are the result of the way we interfere with our movement.</p>

<p>In applying the Alexander Technique, students often free themselves from chronic or sever pains and musculoskeletal problems. They achieve this by stopping the interference that they impose on themselves.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Alexander Technique is not a therapy and it is not an alternative medical modality. It is a learning process.</p>

                                            <p class="lead"><div align="justify"><p>Christos Noulis introduced Somatics for Musicians© in Greece in 2003 giving lectures, masterclasses, workshops and regular lessons to musicians, which aim at improvement of quality in movement and realization of their physical capabilities. Since, a plethora of music students, teachers and performers have benefited from the wealth of theoretical and practical knowledge offered by Somatics for Musicians© and have satisfied their virtuosic demands whilst having freed themselves from somatic issues.</p>

<p>He began studying music at the Macedonian Conservatoire under Maria Georgiadou and graduated with a First Class, First Prize Piano Diploma. He was accepted at the Royal College of Music as an “Exhibition” scholar in the classes of Niel Immelman and Ruth Gerald. He obtained a Diploma in Teaching DipRCM and graduated with a First Class BMus(Hons)RCM degree. He pursued advanced performance studies at the Royal College of Music as a “Leverhulme Trust” scholar and graduated with a Masters degree in Advanced Performance MMus(RCM) in piano performance. His doctoral research at BCU, Birmingham Conservatoire was a seven-year project which examined the effects of Somatic Education on Piano Performance. He also studied the piano regularly with Carmen Bravo-Mompou, Domna Evnouhidou, Ruben Lifschitz, Stephane Lemelin, Roger Vignoles and Valeria Szervansky. He also had lessons with Kenneth Gilbert, Cuthron Sturrock, Robert Sutherland, Martino Tirimo, Dimitar Tsanev, Edna Golandsky and Luba Zuk.</p>

<p>Since 1998, Christos Noulis has had to reconsider his understanding of technique, movement and performance, following a personal RSI syndrome which led to paralysis. His movement rehabilitation was guided by Rolfer Jenny Crewdson, who introduced him to a different perception of physical movement and technique. He studied and applied a multitude of available traditional and alternative methods of therapy and re-education in the UK, Greece, France, Switzerland and Canada.<p>

<p>Since 2000, he expanded his professional interest in the area of performing arts medicine. Having been initiated to Yoga at a young age, he studied Rolfing movement with Jenny Crewdson and Hubert Godard, Body Control and Pilates with Alan Herdman and Tai Chi and Qi Gong with Michael Palmer and Brad Shultz.</p>

<p>Christos trained with Lionel Brannigan and became a certified Pilates instructor in the Rehabilitation Pilates Method®. Following a two year comprehensive training course under the supervision of Jirna Kallidis he became a certified Yoga Therapy (P.E.I.) instructor.</p>

<p>At the Royal College of Music he attended classes in the Alexander Technique with Judith Kleinman and Peter Buckoke and later studied privately with Anne Rees, Kerry Woodward, Annabel Breakfield, Peter Nobes and Penny O’Connor. He has attended many educational seminars and specialized teacher training lessons in the Alexander Technique with Tracy Gil, Simon Gore, Martin Warner, Adrian Bourner, Helena Sime, Ulf Toelle, Jill Tapin, Sandra Tancock, Estella Cauldwell, Richard Cauldwell, Jennifer Mackerras, Jacky Morgan, Veronica Pollard, Caroline Jucker, Pat Young, Oliver Lee, Michael McCulloch, Karen Evans, Linda Rosenberg, Jane Toms, Lynne Cartlidge, Gordon Plant, Aingeala DeBurca, Katey Sleeman, Sabine Bodefeld, Anke Leppke Christa Rahlf, Cathy Aicardi, Emma Jarrett and Catherine Harry.
